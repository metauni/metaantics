# Antics

Antics is a card game within metauni, which serves as a means of creative expression for players.

* The first time a player joins metauni with Scribe permissions or above, they acquire a starter deck.
* Booster packs are acquired by attending seminars or lectures, and spawn randomnly in pockets (the more time spent in a pocket, the more likely it is to find loot).
* Rare and powerful cards are acquired through completing puzzles, challenges or solving math problems set by lecturers.
